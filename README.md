# Dockerfiles

Collection of Dockerfiles I have created to create images from. 

# Collection

## pgdump-s3

Run `pg_dump` to create a backup of a Postgres database and upload the dump to a S3 bucket. 

# Deprecated 

There are many docker images that I have created in the past but I personally no longer have a purpose for these images. When this happens, I no longer maintain a built and updated Docker image for it. I do, however, keep the `Dockerfile` around for reference for anyone to use ðŸ˜„.
